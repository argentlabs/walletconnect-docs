<details className="box faq"><summary className="faq-question">How can I reconnect to the same pairing if my browser was restarted?</summary>
<p className="faq-answer">

 The `signClient` will restore & reconnect its pairings automatically after the page is reloaded. All pairings are stored on the page's `localStorage`.

<details className="box faq"><summary className="faq-question">The default relay endpoint is blocked. How can I get around this?</summary>
<p className="faq-answer">

When initializing `signClient`, you can set `relayUrl` to `wss://relay.walletconnect.org`. 

```js
const signClient = await SignClient.init({
  projectId: "<YOUR PROJECT ID>",
  relayUrl: "wss://relay.walletconnect.org",
  metadata: {},
});
```

<details className="box faq"><summary className="faq-question">How can we use a custom relay for our bridge without a WC URI parameter as the host?</summary>
<p className="faq-answer">

You are more than welcome to utilize a custom URI parameter during testing. However, it is currently not recommended for use in a production environment.

<details className="box faq"><summary className="faq-question">Why is self-hosting not an option at this time? Are there plans to make this possible in the future?</summary>
<p className="faq-answer">

We understand the desire for developers to self-host their own relay. We share this vision, and have embarked on a decentralization roadmap in order to achieve this. This summer, we will launch a permissioned network and invite a select group of partners to participate in this crucial first phase. Our objective is to make self-hosting relay a reality with the creation of the decentralized WalletConnect Network, and we appreciate your patience as we progress in this enormous mission.
